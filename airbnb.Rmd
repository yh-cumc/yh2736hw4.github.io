## Let us make some figure
```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

set.seed(1)

data(nyc_airbnb)

  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(rating), 
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500)  %>% 
  sample_n(5000)

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

```
